# Personalized Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a personalized movie recommendation system developed using collaborative filtering techniques. The system utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with cosine similarity to provide tailored movie recommendations based on user preferences. The recommendation accuracy is enhanced by incorporating movie popularity scores.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on user preferences.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes large datasets of user ratings and movies to compute average ratings and popularity scores.
- **Enhanced Recommendations**: Integrates popularity scores to refine the accuracy of movie suggestions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and model development.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **SciPy**: Scientific computing for implementing machine learning models.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building and optimizing algorithms.
